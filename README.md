3D models I've created. Most are for specific needs, but if they're useful, feel free to use/modify.

Models should also be available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/el_spectre/designs) and [Cults](https://cults3d.com/en/users/elspectre/3d-models)

[Configurable grommets and a half pin](grommet-and-pin) , intended to link a flat surface with a through-hole and a shackle.

[Extra large / odd sized bins for the Stanley 25 bin organizer](stanley-bins-extra-large)
