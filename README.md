3D models I've created. Most are for specific needs, but if they're useful, feel free to use/modify.

Models should also be available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/el_spectre/designs) and [Cults](https://cults3d.com/en/users/elspectre/3d-models)

[grommet-and-pin](grommet-and-pin) are configurable grommets and a half pin, intended to link a flat surface with a through-hole and a shackle.
